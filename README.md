# HW--GraphProject

## Overview

This project aims to create a graph by reading file containing vertices and edges. By doing this, the graph would be able to be traversed via breath first search, dephth first search, dijkstra's algorithm, prim's algorithm, and krustal's algorthm.

## output.txt file

- at least 70% - 80% of all of the clang-tidy warnings are from the graph.h file, graphtext.cpp file, and some code in the graph.cpp file provided to us at the start of this project
- Most of the errors are realated to the '\_\_llvm_libc' namespace
- Many of the wanrings state that variables should be uppercased. They should be lowercase not uppercase.
- The method count() has been used by sets and maps to identify whether an element is in the set or map. The numbers 1 and 0 are purposefully converted into booleans.
